{"text": "Section 1: Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA have revolutionized how machines understand and generate human language. These models use billions of parameters and are trained on diverse datasets across the internet.Section 2: Challenges Despite their strengths, LLMs suffer from hallucinations, context windows, and memory constraints.", "start": 0, "end": 372}
{"text": "One common issue in production is poor document chunking for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where semantic boundaries are ignored. Section 3: Smart Chunking Smart Chunking is an approach that uses sentence embeddings and semantic similarity to intelligently split documents. It avoids breaking thoughts mid-way and improves performance in downstream tasks like question-answering and summarization.", "start": 322, "end": 727}
{"text": "Section 4: Applications Use cases include chunking academic papers for chatbots, splitting financial reports for investors, or slicing user manuals for contextual customer support. Section 5: Conclusion Naive chunking leads to loss of coherence and higher token usage. Smart Chunking fixes this by aligning with natural semantic units, ensuring efficient and reliable document understanding.", "start": 677, "end": 1068}
